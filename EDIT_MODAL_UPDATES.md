# Edit Modal Updates - Completed

## Changes Made

### ✅ **Removed Non-Sheet Fields**
- **Removed SSAN field** - This field doesn't exist in the actual roster data
- **Removed Category selection** - No longer needed for simple edits
- **Removed "Reason for Edit" field** - Changes are not tracked with reasons in the dataframe
- **Removed "Override validation" checkbox** - Not needed for basic edits

### ✅ **Auto-Populate All Available Data**
The edit modal now automatically fills in ALL available member data from the roster:

**Required Fields:**
- FULL_NAME
- GRADE
- DOR (Date of Rank)
- TAFMSD (Total Active Federal Military Service Date)
- DATE_ARRIVED_STATION
- PAFSC (Primary AFSC)
- DAFSC (Desired AFSC)
- ASSIGNED_PAS (PASCODE)
- ASSIGNED_PAS_CLEARTEXT (Unit Name)
- REENL_ELIG_STATUS

**Optional Fields:**
- UIF_CODE
- GRADE_PERM_PROJ (Projected Grade)
- UIF_DISPOSITION_DATE

All fields are automatically populated from the member's current data when the modal opens.

### ✅ **Actual Saving to Dataframes**

#### Backend Endpoint Added
**`PUT /api/roster/member/{session_id}/{member_id}`**

This endpoint:
1. Retrieves the session from Redis
2. Finds the member in ALL dataframes (eligible, ineligible, discrepancy, BTZ, small_unit, pdf_dataframe)
3. Updates the member's data in the relevant dataframe(s)
4. Saves the updated dataframes back to the session
5. Marks the session as "edited"

#### How It Works
- Parses the `member_id` to extract the row index
- Updates that row in the pandas DataFrame with the new data
- Only updates fields that exist in the DataFrame columns
- Persists changes back to Redis session
- Changes are immediately available for PDF generation

### ✅ **Simplified UI Flow**

**Before:**
1. Open edit modal
2. Fill in reason for edit
3. Select category
4. Check override validation
5. Save (but nothing persisted)

**After:**
1. Open edit modal (all data auto-populated)
2. Edit any field you need to change
3. Save (immediately persisted to dataframes)

## Testing the Changes

1. **Upload a roster** through the normal workflow
2. **Go to Review & Edit page**
3. **Click the edit (pencil) icon** on any member
4. **Verify:**
   - All member data is auto-filled
   - No SSAN field
   - No category dropdown
   - No reason field
   - No override checkbox
5. **Edit any field** (e.g., change DOR, update PAFSC, etc.)
6. **Click "Save Changes"**
7. **Verify the change persists:**
   - Close and reopen the edit modal - changes are saved
   - Refresh the preview - changes are still there
   - Generate PDF - changes appear in the PDF

## What Gets Saved

When you save edits, the changes are written to:
- `eligible_df` - If member is in eligible list
- `ineligible_df` - If member is in ineligible list
- `discrepancy_df` - If member is in discrepancy list
- `btz_df` - If member is in BTZ list
- `small_unit_df` - If member is in small units
- `pdf_dataframe` - The dataframe used for PDF generation

All changes persist in the Redis session (30 minute TTL) and will be included in the generated PDF.

## Important Notes

- ✅ Changes are saved immediately to the session
- ✅ No separate "commit" or "apply" step needed
- ✅ Changes persist across page refreshes (within session TTL)
- ✅ PDF generation uses the edited data
- ⚠️ Changes are lost when session expires (30 minutes)
- ⚠️ No undo functionality (yet)
- ⚠️ Changes are not saved to the original uploaded file

## Technical Details

### Frontend (EditMemberModal.jsx)
- Removed unused state variables
- Simplified data structure sent to API
- Auto-population from member props

### Backend (main.py)
- New endpoint: `PUT /api/roster/member/{session_id}/{member_id}`
- Uses pandas DataFrame `.at[]` indexer for efficient updates
- Updates all relevant dataframes in one operation
- Marks session as edited for audit purposes

### API Service (rosterApi.js)
- Simplified API call - just sends member data
- No complex payload structure needed

## Next Steps

If you need additional functionality:
1. **Add Member** - Similar updates needed for AddMemberModal
2. **Delete Member** - Remove from dataframes
3. **Undo/Redo** - Track edit history
4. **Bulk Edit** - Edit multiple members at once
5. **Move Between Categories** - Change member eligibility status
